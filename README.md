# My Neovim Configuration

This repository contains a rolling (live) version of my configuration for Neovim.

## Usage

To use this configuration, simply run the setup.sh script as follows:

```bash
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikebirdgeneau/nvim_config/main/setup.sh)
```

This script is designed for use with Fedora (dnf package manager); other OS / Package managers will require
custom configuration.


## Credit & Inspiration

Credit for the initial version of this configuration goes to [The Primeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen), who created an awesome [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) and [repo](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua) walking through this setup.
